Questions
Why does custom writer for category scores not work with new and save?
What is the right way to set form action when using nested resources?
Why do does the application add the photo category then I have to go back and update these scores?
How would I do this in one method / query etc?
I think it has to do with the way AR treats attributes.
I need to build some sort of object to pass in with all the info. 
Made a mess of this.
